 * (`agent prompt`). Everything else the old observer did - routing

 * command's exit (D-05, D-13).
 *
 * herdr is a convenience, never a contract: the harness must work in a bare
 * terminal, under launchd, and in CI. So every hole reports itself
 * unavailable rather than throwing, and the run degrades to "no pane
 * diagnosis" instead of stopping (R9).
